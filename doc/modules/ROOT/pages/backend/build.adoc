This chapter explains, how OpenEMS Edge can be compiled to a JAR file that can be executed outside of an IDE.

== Build using Eclipse IDE

. Inside Eclipse IDE open the *io.openems.backend.application* project and open the link:https://github.com/OpenEMS/openems/blob/develop/io.openems.backend.application/BackendApp.bndrun[BackendApp.bndrun icon:code[]] file.

. Press btn:[Export] to start the *Export Wizard Selection* assistant.

. Select btn:[Executable JAR] and press btn:[Next >].

. Select a *Destination* for *Export to JAR*.

. Press btn:[Finish]

This creates a so called Fat-JAR-file including all bundles. It can be executed by running `java -jar openems-backend.jar` in a console.

== Build using Gradle from command line

link:https://gradle.org/[Gradle] is a build tool that is used in the OpenEMS project to compile the JAR-files and to execute other tasks like building the documentation webpage using link:https://antora.org/[Antora] and the Javadocs. To build OpenEMS Backend:

. Open a console and change to your repository directory.

. Execute `gradlew buildBackend`
